# Target to pathways analysis with enrichment

# About
Provided collection of protein/gene names as an input, create
statistics for each target pathways and enrich with biological processes

# Results
Score pathways by target presence. 
(Bonus) Estimate target importance by cross-referencing specific cell type Biological processes
and pathways.

# Setup and run
Prepare the list of targets  
`e.g. ['P35462', 'Q9H244', 'P21452' ]`  
 load it in a code cell and run the notebook.

(Optional) Prepare the cross- cell type list of genes as `cross_gene_list`.
